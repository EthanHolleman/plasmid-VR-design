# Config files

This directory is where I keep all non-snakemake config type files. 
This currently includes variable region definition `tsv` files and construct definition `yml` files. The details of both are layed out in the main README file. 

In theory the files in this directory could be located anywhere, you
would just need to change the respective paths in `config.yml` which
is the config file passed to the snakemake parameter `config-file`.
