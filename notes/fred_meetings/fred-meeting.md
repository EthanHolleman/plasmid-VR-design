## Cloning approaches

- restriction enzyme
    - H3 - KpnI with T7 and T3 flanking
    - One blocks are synthized and efficient of cleavage might be
    limited
- Gibson
    - Restriction enzyme independent
    - cut backbone and add fragment with homology
- Cre-lox recombination
    - Not as experience
    - Clone T7 - lox -------- lox - T3
    - in vitro cre recombination
    - lox site is hairpin which can make it harder to use in PCR based stuff

SMRF-seq average length 120 bp 12 turns possibly constrained by supercoiling

Plasmids reducing batch effects. Keeping them as library
one round of transcription. 

If read both then read frequency of formation 

Primers with barcodes

GC and AT skew are crude measurements run R-looper and do that.

mFold is classic.
