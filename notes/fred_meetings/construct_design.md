# Construct design 6/30/21

## TODO List

1. Pick backbone to insert constructs into
2. Identify restriction site for linearization
3. Identify homology strategy 

## Questions

- How would the revese complement sequence be created from the forward
sequence? Transcribe region in antisense directon then reverse transcribe
mRNA to cDNA? How would you initiate transcription?
